=======================

Strawberry is a music player and music collection organizer. It is a fork of Clementine released in 2018 aimed at music collectors, audio enthusiasts and audiophiles. The name is inspired by the band Strawbs. It's based on a heavily modified version of Clementine created in 2012-2013. It's written in C++ and Qt 5.

**Tidal and Qobuz streaming in Strawberry is unofficial. You need an official API token (or App ID/Secret) to use it, we can not provide API tokens, or help getting them. Tidal will not work with Tidal Masters (MQA), because MQA is a proprietary format in lossy quality without an open source decoder, we can't support it.**

It has so far been tested to work on Linux, OpenBSD and Windows.

**We do not provide releases for macOS. There currently isn't any macOS developers actively working on this project.**
